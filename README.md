This project will incorporate Web Components using Polymer (core elements and paper elements), a back-end to store data using Google App Engine (Java) with Objectify, and the front-end frameworks, Angular (1.3 initially) and Bootstrap, if needed.

Jan 20-26: Integrating Polymer into a Gulp project wasn't working, and I saw a Grunt scaffolding repo that seemed to work, so I've downloaded it and tried it, but things don't seem to be working all the way. In app/styles/main.scss, I cannot overwrite the background color of the core-toolbar like Eric Bidelman could in his tutorial. Also, none of the content in the content div is showing up.

This website will function as my wedding website (D-day being Oct 3rd). It will have some static pages, but it will also have some dynamic pages/functionality, including RSVP online using Google's Open ID and a code printed on the RSVP paper mailings, Voting for hores d'voires and other foods, and our Registry.

Intended Pages:

Home - our story, maybe a slider and some pictures here and there, and three boxes containing info / clickthroughs to other pages

RSVP - users can use their Google account, facebook, or twitter to register (combined with their wedding invite) to become a priveleged user and send their RSVP status electronically

The Ceremony - short description of church, time of ceremony, priest, Google map with directions (if "get directions" is clicked), and pictures of the church where the ceremony will happen

The Reception - short description of the venue (Old Bust Head Brewery), the DJ, amenities (photo booth), and a list of the beers that will be on-tap and open bar, and the food. Food will be the must-haves that the Bride and I decide on, plus the results of the poll on the Food page, displayed dynamically

Make My Day - description and video of the foods that will definitely be made in mass quantities at the wedding (D-Day), the chef, and some pictures of the same. Also, a poll with different combinations of sides and hores d'voires will capture one vote per registered priveleged user. The results will be displayed on this page and on Reception page

Registry - a list of things the woman wants, plus a kegerator

Pictures - before the wedding will be stupid sappy pictures of us walking in the woods and crap, and other pictures of us together doing random stuff, I guess. After the wedding it will show our wedding pictures from the hired photographer.
